      Our doctoral programme is a full-time research programme with expected duration of 4-years. For the successful completion of this programme, a high level of commitment is required.
      
      Students are therefore expected to reside close to the University and be a full-time participant in the program. With guidance from postgraduate committee, Ph.D. students will create a personalized program of study that includes a major area of specialization and at least two minor areas of specialization.
      
      In addition to coursework, the department holds regular seminars where students and faculty review and critique research in the field. To foster prudent critique, students are expected to join at most one research lab and participate in research activities carried out by the group. The research areas of the department are Intelligent Space and Machine Learning, Data Science/Big Data Analytics, Networking and Communications Engineering, and Cyber Security

                  MPhil / MSc Programmes
                </h5>
                <p>
                  The Department of Computer Science – University of Ghana currently runs Masters of Science (MSc.) in Computer Science and Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) in Computer Science.
      
      The MSc. is a 1-year (weekend/evening) programme with a capstone project while the MPhil is a 2-year (full-time) programme. The first year of the MPhil is taught course and second year is research and dissertation. Both programmes are accelerated master’s programme specially designed to train current and future computer scientist who are available for full-time or part-time study.
      
      Students enrolled in these programmes are equipped with broader knowledge in theoretical computer science and advance technical skills to approach science in technology as a disruptive force to manage complex problems of the global society. At the end of these programmes, students will gain hands-on experience in solving complex, and unstructured scientific problems while learning subjects like Advance Databases, Advance Data Structures and Algorithms and Networks
